Spoiler alert: in this post, I will argue that Python is the best programming language for scientists to learn. Forget Perl, Java, FORTRAN, IDL, or whatever else they were pushing when you got your degree. This type of discussion is usually emotionally charged -- many a flame war has been fought over programming languages. Feelings will get hurt. Heads will roll. But first ...

## Do scientists even need to learn to program?

- No.
- But.

## Does it matter what language you learn (first)?

- language isn't everything
- that said, python iz best, here's why

## The universe wants you to learn Python

- Mouse and the Python (?)
- Invent with Python
- Coursera
- LPTHW
- Codenhance LOLZ

## The universe wants you to be productive in Python

- astropy, numpy, BioPython, bokeh
- JuPyter notebooks (?)

## Open source, open data, etc.

- TODO
- But for real, IDL?

## Python omnipresence

- used by google, idk who else
- X projects on GitHub
- open source
