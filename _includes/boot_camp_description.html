            <h2 class="title text-center">Learn by doing</h2>    
	    <p>Coding isn't a game, and you won't master it by typing into your browser. Learn to control and customize your development environment, manage your code, and share your projects. Write and run real code to analyze biological data.</p>

	    <br />

            <h2 class="title text-center">Be social</h2>    
	    <p>Great software is built by teams. There's no need to hide in a corner while you learn to code -- start sharing your programs and learning about open source projects created by like-minded people.</p>

	    <br />

	    <h2 class="title text-center">Go at your own pace</h2>
	    <p>You'll get one email per day for five days. Complete them at whatever pace works for you. Stuck? Just hit "reply" and let me help.</p>
