## Inviting students

- Invite best communicators first and make them admins 
- Decide on channels (cite http://www.sqrlab.ca/blog/2015/11/29/using-slack-in-the-classroom/)
- Have them invite others
- Discuss expectations FTF
  - Make sure everybody understands @mentions
  - Channels
  - DM for personal stuff
  - Private messages really are private
  - Response time -- I think it'd be good to discuss "How long should it take to get back to somebody?"
  - I never gave any moralistic cautionary preaching and it didn't seem to be necessary

## Customizing your site

- @slackbot responses and custom emojis and student profiles and stuff -- do it!
- Everybody customizes it. I offered points for Slack participation. It was fun.

## Things to watch out for

- Too many channels
- Informality
- Easier to talk shit when it's not face to face
- Not a silver bullet of course ... but charleston tho

## Next steps

- Have fun!
