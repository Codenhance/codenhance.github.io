## About astronomy

- WTF do astronomers do all day anyway?
  - Observational and theoretical
- Where to get astro data and what it looks like when you get it (FITS format)
  - http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_samples.html has a list

## Python use in astronommy

- IDL vs Python (legacy vs newcomer, proprietary vs open source)
- Specific example: Subaru Telescope base station (a mile from my house) uses Python extensively

## Getting started with astropy

- This is attrib only: http://astropy4mpik.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fits.html (more short and sweet)
- This is astropy, so BSD? http://www.astropy.org/astropy-tutorials/FITS-images.html (does more stuff, should prolly use this)
- download a nebula and make a pretty picture
- wanna go further? do you math? check out this tutorial and exercise set on Quantities http://www.astropy.org/astropy-tutorials/Quantities.html

## Trying out Vispy

- run spiral galaxy simulation and modify it. BSD license: https://github.com/vispy/vispy/blob/master/examples/demo/gloo/galaxy.py
- wanna X? check out Y.

## What to do next

- Crowdsourced citizen science astro project (I know the guy, but I forgot the name)
- other projects TODO
