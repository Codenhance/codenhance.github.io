## About astronomy

- WTF do astronomers do all day anyway?
- Where to get astro data and what it looks like when you get it (FITS format)

## Python use in astronommy

- IDL vs Python (legacy vs newcomer, proprietary vs open source)
- Specific example: Subaru Telescope base station (a mile from my house) uses Python extensively

## Getting started with astropy

- download a nebula and make a pretty picture
- do something else TODO

## Trying out Vispy

- run spiral galaxy simulation and modify it
- do something else TODO

## What to do next

- Crowdsourced citizen science astro project (I know the guy, but I forgot the name)
- other projects TODO
