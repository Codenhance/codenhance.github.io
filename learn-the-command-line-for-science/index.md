## A complete video course 

I'm creating this course for scientists and science majors who have no programming experience. Or whose programming experience has left them feeling frustrated and empty.

Learning the command line is a requirement for scientific computing, and it's also the gateway to *finally* understanding how your computer works. It's the first step toward crunching your own data and building your own computational tools. And it's _fun_.

## 3 ways to help

If you'd like to see this course become a reality, I need your help! Here's what you can do:

1. Back the project on Kickstarter. There are funding levels starting as low as $5. [Note: coming soon, just need a URL]

2. Share on social media. Tweet or share a link on Facebook to let your network know about the class! [Note: coming soon, just need a URL]

3. Join the mailing list for updates. Scroll down and enter your email address and I'll keep you up on the latest developments.

Thanks!
