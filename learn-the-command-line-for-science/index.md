## Start from zero

This video course is designed for scientists with little or no programming experience. It's okay if you've never even touched the command line (or if you did once but it felt icky).

## Gain super powers

You'll have fun learning a new, powerful way of communicating with your computer. Along the way, you'll acquire access to a whole world of amazing open source data and software. Who knows what you'll do next?
