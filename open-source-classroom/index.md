I completed a Master's degree in Information and Computer Science last summer, and started teaching my first university class (Python Programming) about two weeks later. I'm a self-taught programmer who mostly learned on the job; though I've [taught](TODO keikitech) programming in several settings, a university class is a different beast. To add to the fun, my students ranged from true beginners trying to learn to code to experienced programmers looking to try out a new language. By rights I should have been doomed from the start.

## Open source saved my life

Despite the challenges presented by my students' diversity of experience and interests, we managed to get through the semester with a minimal amount of soul-crushing boredom, and several students even learned some Python along the way. This was facilitated entirely by the wealth of open source educational materials and tools available in the Python universe. 

Instead of forcing students to spend $150 on a dry textbook and type through examples that confuse half of the class while boring the other half to tears, I was able to lift the textbook requirement entirely. Instead of one overpriced book, the class used several high-quality, up-to-date, *free* books. Instead of trudging through the same old "implement a linked list" or "build a library lending app" examples that so failed to inspire me during my own education, I was able to assign students tasks like "simulate a galaxy," "design primers for a biological experiment," "make a platformer video game," or "build a web service."

## Open source textbooks

Help for the beginners in the class came in the form of Charles Severance's [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/html-270/) book (Creative Common Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License). This is the same textbook used in Coursera's "Programming for Everybody" course. Not every student needed such a gentle introduction to the language, but I offered points to any student who typed the code examples from the book and blogged about what they learned.

More experienced programmers who wanted a different kind of introduction to Python were able to jump right in to game programming thanks to the GPL-licensed [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org) module and Al Sweigart's Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial Share Alike 3.0 - licensed textbook [Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/chapters/). The students who opted for this approach got points for typing example code from the textbook, and eventually learned to modify the code to create their own games.
