excerpt: "An interview with programmers working at a telescope"

I recently had an email exchange with a Software Engineer working on one of our local telescopes.

When I asked him about what tools he and his team use to study the sky, his response was basically a lesson plan from this site:

What do you use for version control?

> *Git.*

What operating system(s) are in use at your facility?

> *Linux (Ubuntu and Centos) for servers, Linux (Ubuntu) and Macs for scientific desktops/laptops. I think there are a few windows pcs in accounting and maybe a few laptops with it.*

What text editors and/or IDEs do you use for development?

> *Most of us use emacs or another text editor. Once in a while one of us will try an IDE, but we’re kind of old school in that way.*

What skills do you look for in interns or new hires?

> *Desirable skills that we frequently look for are python programming, scientific programming, version control, issue tracker experience, test-driven development, linux experience, sys admin experience, astronomy knowledge.*

Real world programmers and researchers look for candidates who have experience with an entire computing environment, not just a language. Looking to further your career in scientific computing? Work on your Python skills, sure, but don’t forget Linux, git, and all the fun that comes with them.
