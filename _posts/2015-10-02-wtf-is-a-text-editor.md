A text editor is a program that runs on your computer that allows you to ... edit text. So WTF is text?

## Text is complicated

This is not a trivial subject. [Here](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html) is the best explanation I've seen; try reading it in a couple of months. For now, just think of "text" or "plain text" as "characters you can type with your keyboard, without any fancy formatting".

TODO gif of typing plain text

This web page contains fancy formatting -- headers, links, even *stuff like this*. It was written as plain text, though. [Take a look](TODO).

## Text is simple

- link to .md file of this page (?)
- html, python and other languages, config files, fasta files, gff files, bed files and other data
- every machine you'll come across has a text editor for configuring, usually vi.
  - vi/Vim
  - link to 'how to vim'

## Not all text editors are created equal

- Notepad works but painful
- GUIs seldom run across remote connections
- Vim and Emacs are popular command line choices
- Link to Vim resources (?)
